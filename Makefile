#   make demo            build and boot the demo's disk under Lima (macOS on Apple silicon)

# FORM picks the form (default sshd; make lima implies lima, make bite-me

# given. Nothing on the machine reads an allowance from its command line,
# config or metadata, which root can rewrite: the build turns them into the
# image's kernel arguments and module parameters, below, and the image is
# what decides (docs/design/lockdown.md, Allowances). A name not here fails the
# build.

#   nested-kvm  and let their guests run virtual machines too; needs kvm
#   netadmin    CAP_NET_ADMIN after boot, which fence otherwise drops: to
#               change addresses, routes and fence's rules. DHCP needs none:
#               init starts its renewal before fence

# times the size (57 MB, against this 19.7 MB and LZMA's 12.4). The update
# downloads the root as it is (docs/releases.md), so it stays compressed.
# Level 9 writes it in 7 s and level 19 in 88 s for 2 MB less; zstd reads
# as fast at any level. Homebrew's erofs-utils has no zstd, so
# tools/install-deps builds one that has. -b 4096 because mkfs.erofs

# 1970, and the UUID is fixed (stage0 finds the image by path), so a rebuild
# matches, on macOS as on Wolfi. erofs-utils before 1.9 (Ubuntu 24.04 has
