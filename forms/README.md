# forms

Each directory here is a form ([docs/forms.md](../docs/forms.md)), and
holds everything about it: a new form is a new directory.

```text
forms/NAME/
  form.yaml       the form: what apko installs, and what apko cannot say (below)
  rootfs/         files laid over the packages: path here, path in the image
  cmd/PROGRAM/    a program only this form needs, PROGRAM.zig, built and laid
                  at /usr/lib/werewolf/PROGRAM (docs/programs.md)
  melange/        recipes for packages Wolfi does not ship (docs/forms.md)
  test/checks     make check's checks for it, beside test/checks
  test/config     writes its config for make check: config DIR
  test/console    console lines its as-shipped boot must show
  README.md       what it is, how to use it, what it refuses, and how data comes in (TEMPLATE.md)
```

A form has the parts of every form in its chain, base first and its own
last, so its files win; `make list-forms` shows each chain. CI publishes
each form but those with melange recipes as NAME-form
([docs/releases.md](../docs/releases.md#packages)), and howl takes a form
by name from there, so the machine updates it; `--build` takes this tree's.

## form.yaml

| Key | Is | Along the chain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | the form it is built on, a name in forms/ | |
| `with` | forms it takes beside its base, as a Mastodon takes `[postgresql, valkey, nginx]`: their parts come before its own | added to |
| `packages` | the Wolfi packages apko installs, by name | added to |
| `accounts`, `paths` | what apko installs beyond packages, in apko's own shape: `accounts` its `groups` and `users`, each with a numbered id, for an account something depends on by number or shell (a login account, a program's fixed uid); a service's user needs none, its id being its name's hash. `paths` its permissions. `repositories`, `keyring` and `archs` are minimal's alone | added to; `archs` the last form's |
| `programs` | programs from cmd/ its machines run beyond every form's: prod's `dhcp-client`, postgresql's `popen-shim.so` (a library) | added to |
| `allow` | what it takes back of werewolf's defaults ([lib/allow.zig](../lib/allow.zig)): `kvm`, `nested-kvm`, `netadmin`, `packet`, `ipv6`, `pty` (ssh logins), `jit` (a runtime that compiles code as it runs), `sh` (every leashed service may run the sh shim). The image holds each in `/etc/werewolf/allow`, where the machine reads it | added to |
| `app` | where `howl --app DIR` lays an application: `/usr/lib/app`, nginx's `/usr/share/nginx/html` | the last form's |
| `services` | its leashed services, one a name: leash's directives as keys ([cmd/leash](../cmd/leash/leash.zig) lists them), a value one line, a list one line each, which the build writes as `etc/sv/NAME/service` with `run` and `finish` on leash. `listen` and `connect` take a net line's words (`tcp/PORT`, `udp/PORT`, `icmp`, `public`, `loopback`): leash holds the TCP, fence the rest, so a service's network is said once. `image: REF` runs it in that image's tree, baked at `/oci/NAME` as `_oci-NAME` with the image's own command and environment, or `exec`'s; a tag is followed, the build baking its digest of the day ([docs/design/oci.md](../docs/design/oci.md)); `run DIR/` runs what is beneath DIR in it; `link: [NAME...]` reaches those services' ports on loopback | whole, last by name |
| `users` | the machine's people, the top manifest's alone (a form others take may name none): each a name with `keys:` (lines of a `.pub`, security keys' unless `sshd:` takes key files) and `admin: true`, whose keys are root's too. Never in the image: `howl` packs them into the boot config, and init makes each an account (uid its name's hash in 1000-60000, home `/data/home/NAME`, ash where busybox gives one) and its keys file; `howl --users.NAME.keys LINE`, `--users.NAME.admin` | the top form's |
| `updates` | how the machine keeps itself current (docs/updater.md): `every: 1h` (5m to 7d) between checks, or `off`, which leaves the autoupdate service out of the image; `howl --updates off`, `--updates.every 1h` | the last form's |
| `net` | the network of what is no service, as the updater's fetcher (`connect _update tcp/443 udp/53 tcp/53`) or root's: `listen tcp/PORT... [loopback]`, `listen USER udp/PORT...` (a kernel's socket, as WireGuard's, is root's), `connect USER\|all tcp/PORT udp/PORT icmp [public]`, `metadata USER`; a line for a service's user is refused ([docs/design/fence.md](../docs/design/fence.md)); `build/host/form listens FORM` lists the ports it serves | added to |
| `prune` | files its packages bring that nothing runs, as each is in the image: `usr/bin/bash` | added to |
| `dev` | packages for DEV=1 builds alone: a daemon's client, for its checks | added to |
| `modules` | kernel modules it loads, `MODULE...`; `ARCH MODULE...` for one arch (`aarch64 virtio_mmio`); `@TAG MODULE...` for a machine stage0 tags (`"@xfs xfs"`, quoted, as YAML wants a value that starts with @); both, arch first: `aarch64 @hyperv hv_netvsc` | added to |
| `weaknesses` | the posture checks it fails, each with its excuse: why this image has the weakness, not what the check tests. `?ID` may fail or not, as the host decides. None named, none excused: any posture failure fails `make check` | its own |
| `sshd` | sshd_config settings, each named in lowercase with dashes, from a closed list ([lib/sshd.zig](../lib/sshd.zig)): `pubkey-accepted-algorithms: ssh-ed25519,sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com` lets key files in beside security keys. The image holds them in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/form.conf`, which sshd reads before werewolf's policy. Only where the chain has the `sshd` form or the `bastion`; a setting posture checks wants its weakness named. howl's `--sshd.KEYWORD=VALUE` writes the same | a later form's value in place of its base's |
| `bastion` | the bastion's users: `users:`, each a name with `keys:` (lines of a `.pub`, security keys' unless `sshd:` takes key files) and `destinations:` (literal `ADDRESS:PORT`s). The image holds them in `/etc/ssh/bastion`, each key held to its user's destinations ([bastion](bastion/README.md)) | added to |
| `check` | how `make check` boots it: `memory` (MiB, a number), `offline: true`, `web` (a port test/boot drives from the host), `skip` (a list of the checks of test/checks it skips), `native: false` (not checked under systemd-nspawn, as every other form is; say why). `offline` and `native` are `true` or `false`; anything else fails the build | its own |

What a form's chain gives it, it cannot take away, only add to. Its own
keys are its own because they describe the machine as built: a form on
`python` that ships no interpreter would fail no check, so it does not
inherit `python`'s excuse. `make check` fails a machine on any posture
failure its form does not excuse, and on any excused one that passes;
[test/posture-known](../test/posture-known) holds what every form of a
kind fails (a DEV=1 build's shell, an architecture's gap). The image
carries both, with their excuses, in `/usr/share/werewolf/weaknesses`, so
every machine knows which failures are expected: posture marks each
excused one in its JSON and warns on the console of any other, wherever
it boots.

```yaml
# forms/python/form.yaml
base: app

net:
  - listen tcp/8080

weaknesses:
  programs-no-interpreters: python3 runs the application, which is what this form is for
```

Both files are YAML in the small part of it they are written in: block
maps and lists indented with spaces, plain or quoted scalars, `[a, b]`,
and `#` comments. A key this page does not list, or YAML apko might read
some other way (anchors, tags, multi-line scalars, inline maps), fails
the build with its file and line.

## What apko installs

A form's `packages`, `accounts` and `paths` (and minimal's `repositories`,
`keyring` and `archs`) are an apko config in form.yaml's own keys:
werewolf merges the chain's into one, base first, by the rules apko's
deprecated `include:` used (lists joined, maps merged by key, everything
else the last form's), and apko builds that. `build/host/form apko NAME`
prints it.

`accounts` are added again on a machine's update, which installs with
apk, not apko (lib/compose.zig): a user's `homedir` is `/var/empty` (or
`/dev/null`), since nothing on the machine would make another, and a
service writes where its service file's `write` says.

A service's `user` needs no account there: one no form names gets its
own, uid and gid a hash of its name in 65536-2147483647, home
`/var/empty`, shell `/sbin/nologin`, the same on every build. Name the
account to pick its ids. Each service runs as a user of its own: two
that share one, or a hash that lands on an id taken, fail the build.

## A new form

1. `forms/NAME/form.yaml`: `base: prod`, or a runtime form; its
   `packages`; and its `net`.
2. its `services`: how leash starts each, as whom, on which ports
   ([cmd/leash](../cmd/leash/leash.zig) lists the directives).
3. `forms/NAME/test/checks`: what proves it works, and what it refuses.
4. `make check-NAME`, then name each posture failure in `weaknesses`
   with its excuse, or fix it.

A form outside this tree builds the same way: `make FORM=../myapp`, a
form named after its directory, built on forms here. howl takes one by its
path (`--with ./myapp`), built on the published forms, and the machine
never updates it.
