# token revoked. An admin, who may do everything, logging in by userpass
# with the password the config brought (/run/config/openbao/admin_password;
# leash's copy is read here). A bcrypt hash in its place (password_hash)
# waits on an OpenBao after 2.5, which Wolfi ships; the admin changes the
# password at the first login.
