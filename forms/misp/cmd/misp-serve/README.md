# misp-serve

## Summary

misp-serve starts PHP, on loopback, and one of each MISP worker. The list is the program. Nothing else can add to it.

## Background

The image runs supervisord, which is Python, as root, so it can switch its children to `www-data`. It also opens a control socket. On this form the leash has already become `_oci-misp`, and the web process is that same user. A control socket would let a request start whatever the leash allows.

## Goals

- PHP listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` and nowhere else.
- The workers are the five queues and the scheduler, one each.
- The service executes no Python. The check `misp-serve` finds `misp-serve` and no `python` or `supervisord` in the service's processes.

## Non-Goals

- A supervisor control socket, or a config file of programs.
- Running the web process and the workers as different users. They share the image, and werewolf has no writable volume between two images.

## Detailed design

misp-run finishes the database and the administrator, then replaces itself with misp-serve. misp-serve forks the seven programs and waits. The arguments are in the binary. On SIGTERM, or when any child exits, it signals the others and exits. runit starts the service again. Cake is a shell script, so bash stays on the leash; Python does not.

## Drawbacks

One worker exiting restarts PHP as well. That is the whole service coming back, rather than a process left running with no one watching it.

## Alternatives Considered

- supervisord without `user=root`. It would still be Python, and its socket would still be a way to start programs.
- Leaving the workers in the background of the shell. A worker that exited would stay down until the whole machine restarted.
