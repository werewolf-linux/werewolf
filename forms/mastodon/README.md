# Mastodon - Hardened VM

[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) for one server, with PostgreSQL, Valkey, and Caddy. The form's manifest is [form.yaml](form.yaml).

## Security Posture

- Each program runs as its own user. The root is read-only. `/data` is what survives.
- Sign-up is closed. The owner is created once, when the database is new.
- PostgreSQL and Valkey are on UNIX sockets. The host cannot reach them.

### Weaknesses

- Ruby and Node run Mastodon, which is what this form is for.
- PostgreSQL compiles costly queries to machine code with LLVM.

## Getting Started

### Local test deployment (lima, qemu, firecracker)

```sh
openssl rand -base64 24 >owner-password
howl create mastodon --with mastodon \
	--domain social.home.arpa --owner alice --owner-email alice@example.com \
	--owner-password owner-password
```

Open `https://social.home.arpa` and sign in as the owner. The domain is the server's name from then on. Administration is in [Mastodon's documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/).

### Cloud production deployment (aws, gcp, azure, proxmox)

```sh
openssl rand -base64 24 >owner-password
howl create mastodon --with mastodon --on gcp --allow-from me \
	--domain social.example.com --owner alice --owner-email alice@example.com \
	--owner-password owner-password
```

`--allow-from me` admits your address to ports 80 and 443. Point the domain at the machine before you create it.

### Importing data

`--import` streams `*.sql` into the `postgres` database, and one `dump.rdb` into Valkey, once, while data is first made. Media and settings files are not on that disk. A cloud cannot attach it. Delete the machine before a second import.

```sh
howl create mastodon --with mastodon --import ./dump \
	--domain social.home.arpa --owner alice --owner-email alice@example.com \
	--owner-password owner-password
```

### Known Quirks

- Give the machine 4 GB. The first boot migrates the database.
- The owner password is a file with no newline.

### Network Exposure

- listen: tcp/80 *
- listen: tcp/443 *
