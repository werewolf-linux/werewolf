# bite

`bite`, a POSIX shell script, takes over a Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or Rocky
VM using the distro's own GRUB tools. It is for providers that will not
boot a custom image. Once werewolf has committed, `bite-cleanup`, a Zig
program in werewolf, deletes the distro.

```sh
make bite-me                            # on the VM: build, take over, look, reboot
make FORM=prod slot                     # build/<arch>/prod/slot/
sudo ./bite -n DIR                      # check, and show the plan
sudo ./bite -i [--config X] DIR         # take over, look inside, ask to reboot
sudo ./bite --reboot [--config X] DIR   # take over, and reboot into werewolf
sudo ./bite --undo                      # from the distro: remove werewolf
bite-cleanup [-n]                       # in werewolf, after commit: delete the distro
```

DIR holds a slot (*Slots*, below) of any form.

**`make bite-me` does it all on the VM.** Run in a clone of this
repository, it builds `prod-ssh`'s slot, the form that can still be
reached by ssh afterwards, and runs `bite -i` on it. `FORM=` picks another,
and `config/`, if present, joins the config tar. The build needs apko, Zig
and erofs-utils 1.9 or later; `make install-deps` installs them.

**`-i` looks before it leaps.** After installing, bite mounts the new
root read-only, with the distro's kernel, and opens the image's own shell
in it. Leaving the shell asks whether to reboot into werewolf now. A form
without a shell skips the look, and so does a kernel that cannot mount
the image. Either way the question is still asked.

**Nothing is removed or repartitioned.** The slot's kernel and stage0 go in
`/boot/werewolf/<slot>`; `root.erofs`, `config.tar` and `data/` go in
`/var/lib/werewolf`.

**werewolf boots once, then must prove itself.** bite adds GRUB entries
`werewolf-a` and `werewolf-b` and boots `werewolf-a` once (`grub-reboot`).
When every service has stayed up for a minute, and the updater, where the
form has one, has said it can update, the `slot-keep` service makes that
slot GRUB's default; until then, a reset returns to the distro.

**It refuses rather than strand a machine**: the wrong architecture, Secure
Boot on (shim will not load Alpine's unsigned kernel), a NIC or disk that is
not virtio, LVM or LUKS, or a filesystem other than ext4, xfs or btrfs.

**It carries over the live network** as a static address: cloud
addresses come from DHCP but do not change, and a provider without DHCP
works the same. The config tar gets the
hostname and the ssh keys of root and of the sudo user.

**The victim stays visible, not writable.** werewolf mounts the distro's
filesystem read-only at `/victim`; `/data`, bound from it, stays writable.
Root can still remount it; this guards against mistakes and non-root code.

**`bite-cleanup` ends the fallback.** Once werewolf commits, the distro is
stale and still holds its secrets, cloud-init's user-data among them. Run in
werewolf, `bite-cleanup` deletes everything but `/var/lib/werewolf` and, on
the same filesystem, the directory GRUB's is in (`/boot`, or `/@/boot` in a
btrfs subvolume), then trims the freed blocks. It refuses before commit,
and deletes nothing unless it finds the running slot's `root.erofs` and
kernel in what it keeps, reached through no link. The deleting is done by a
child process that can do nothing else: `no_new_privs`, only the
capabilities that pass files' owners and modes, Landlock allowing nothing
but reading directories and removing beneath the victim's filesystem, and a
seccomp filter of the few calls that takes. A file it may not delete, such
as one a cloud agent made immutable (`chattr +i`), it names and leaves,
deletes everything around it, and exits 1. Freed blocks are not erased,
and earlier snapshots still hold the distro.

## Tested

In Lima (aarch64, UEFI and GRUB), with the RAM-root image; slots so far on
Debian 13 only:

| Distro | Filesystem | `/boot` | Committed, survives a power cycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Debian 13 | ext4 | on root | yes |
| Ubuntu 26.04 | ext4 | ext4 partition | yes |
| Fedora 44 | btrfs | btrfs subvolume | yes |
| Rocky 10 | xfs | xfs partition | yes |

A reset before commit returned to the distro. `bite --undo` left nothing
behind. On 2026-10-06, on Debian 13, a slot booted with the kernel
arguments GRUB's environment held for it, `werewolf_args_a`, changed after
bite to add one: the entries read them at each boot (*Slots*). The BLS
entries Fedora and Rocky take are not yet tested so. Cleanup took Debian from 1.6 GB to 105 MB and Fedora from 1.1 GB
to 117 MB, and both rebooted into werewolf with `/data` intact.

To test in Lima: until the instance restarts, Lima's ssh runs over vsock,
which werewolf does not provide; after `limactl stop` and `start`, use
`ssh -F ~/.lima/NAME/ssh.config`. `limactl start` never reports a bitten
instance READY, since it waits for Lima's guest agent, and `limactl stop`
forces the VM off.

## Slots

A bitten machine boots a *slot*: the rootfs kept on disk, read-only.
`make slot` builds one in `build/<arch>/<form>/slot/`:

| File | Installed in | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vmlinuz` | `/boot/werewolf/<slot>/` | Alpine's kernel; on arm64 the raw Image, unpacked from the slot's EFI zboot image, which GRUB cannot load |
| `initramfs.zst` | `/boot/werewolf/<slot>/` | stage0: werewolf's stage0 and module loader, the form's modules |
| `root.erofs` | `/var/lib/werewolf/<slot>/` | the rootfs |
| `cmdline` | GRUB's environment, as `werewolf_args_<slot>` | the kernel arguments the image asks for |

bite's GRUB entries name each slot's kernel arguments by that variable,
not by value, so the arguments an image asks for reach the machine with
the image: bite sets `werewolf_args_a`, and the updater the other slot's
before it gives that slot its one try. `bite --undo` removes both.

stage0 mounts `root.erofs` read-only, directly at `/`, as on every form; a
direct boot carries the same image in its initramfs. Pages load on demand
and can be reclaimed.

**Two slots, one try each.** The committed slot is GRUB's default. A new
slot gets one boot (`next_entry`) and stays only if `slot-keep` finds it
healthy. Every failure ends on the previous slot:

| Failure | Recovery | Tested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GRUB cannot load the kernel | GRUB's `fallback` | |
| stage0 cannot mount the root | stage0 exits, the kernel panics, `panic=10` reboots | yes |
| `/init` will not run | `init=/init` makes it a panic | |
| the kernel locks up | `softlockup_panic=1` makes it a panic | |
| it boots but never gets healthy | stage0's deadman reboots it at ten minutes | yes |

`prod`, and every form on it, builds new slots on the machine itself; see
[updater.md](updater.md).
