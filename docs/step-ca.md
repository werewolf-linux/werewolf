# step-ca

The `step-ca` form is `prod` with step-ca 0.30, an internal certificate
authority, named for what runs, as `postgresql` is.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Listens | tcp/443: ACME, and the CA's API |
| Sends | to a requester's tcp/80, ACME's http-01, and DNS to find it (`connect step tcp/80 tcp/53 udp/53`) |
| Runs as | `step` (uid 209), leashed |
| Keeps | its database (badger) in `/data/svc/step-ca/db` |
| Config | `step-ca/root.crt`, `step-ca/intermediate.crt`, `step-ca/intermediate.key` (encrypted), `step-ca/password` (the key's); settings `names` (the CA's own, required) and `domains` (what ACME may issue for, required) |

The root's key never comes to the machine: make the root and the
intermediate where the root's key lives (`step certificate create`, or
openssl as [test/config-step-ca](../test/config-step-ca) does), and give
the machine the intermediate alone.

```sh
build/host/werewolf pack step-ca -o config.tar --config config \
	--names ca.example.internal --domains example.internal,app.example.internal
```

## Defaults

- **One provisioner, ACME**, which is most of why people run one, with
  `http-01`, `tls-alpn-01` and `dns-01`. It is bound by an x509 policy
  that allows only the `domains` listed, and the service parks without
  them. The policy holds for every provisioner.
- **No remote administration** (`enableAdmin` off): `ca.json` in the
  image is the only way to change provisioners. A form of your own lays
  its `etc/step-ca/ca.json` over this one to add a JWK provisioner for
  its operators (its public key is not a secret, so it belongs in the
  image, not the config).
- **Certificates live 24 hours**, as step-ca ships; a provisioner's
  claims raise it for clients that cannot renew daily.
- TLS 1.2 at least, ECDSA suites with AEAD, no renegotiation.

## Checked

`make check-step-ca` makes a root and an intermediate for the run
([test/config-step-ca](../test/config-step-ca)), names the CA `localhost`
and allows `example.test`, and runs [test/checks-step-ca](../test/checks-step-ca):
`/health` and `/roots` answer over TLS; the ACME directory is served; the
rendered `ca.json` holds exactly those names and `enableAdmin: false`;
the admin API is refused; the root's key is nowhere on the machine; and
the intermediate's key and password are `step`'s, 0600.
