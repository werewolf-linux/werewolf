# Clouds

On GCP, AWS, Hetzner Cloud and Azure, a werewolf machine can take its config from
the cloud's metadata server: the same config tar a config disk carries,
set as the instance's user data. `prod`, and every form on it, asks.

The [bastion](../examples/bastion/README.md) and
[Tailscale router](../examples/tailscale/README.md) tutorials use restricted
JSON boot settings for destinations/routes, plus separate credential files.
For local Lima, init imports `provision: mode: data` files targeting
`/run/config/...` from the NoCloud volume: at most 32 regular files of
32 KiB, root-owned, mode `0600`. It runs no cloud-init or Lima provisioning
scripts. The `lima.env` index is also limited to 32 KiB. GCP uses the same
files in the base64 config tar described below.
See [service VM deployment](service-vms.md).

## Setting it up

For an end-to-end image build and GCP deployment, start with the
[language tutorials](../examples/README.md). Each includes a form, a Makefile
for QEMU and GCP, verification commands and cloud resource cleanup.

Make the config tar as for a config disk ([README](../README.md#configure-it)),
then hand it to the cloud in base64:

```sh
tar -cf config.tar -C config .
base64 <config.tar >config.b64

# GCP: the instance's user-data attribute
gcloud compute instances create web-1 --metadata-from-file user-data=config.b64 ...
# AWS: the instance's user data, as text
aws ec2 run-instances --user-data file://config.b64 ...
# Hetzner Cloud
hcloud server create --name web-1 --user-data-from-file config.b64 ...
# Azure: the tar itself, which az encodes in base64
az vm create --name web-1 --user-data config.tar ...
```

There is no address to give: the machine asks DHCP. A `network` file in
the user data is not read, the network being up to fetch it; one on a
config disk is, before the network comes up ([design/cli.md](design/cli.md#config-the-config-tar-from-flags)).
A NoCloud seed's `network-config` (cloud-init's v1 and v2) is never read:
the address comes from the command line, the config tar or DHCP.

## What happens at boot

init looks for a config tar on a disk and beside the victim, and for
NoCloud, as always. Only where it finds none does it run
`/usr/lib/werewolf/cloud-metadata`, after the network is up:

1. It reads the firmware's DMI strings. `Google Compute Engine`, `Amazon
   EC2` or `Hetzner` is a cloud it knows, as is Hyper-V's `Virtual
   Machine` with the chassis asset tag only Azure sets; anything else, a
   desktop's Hyper-V included, and it asks no one. A neighbour on a flat network could answer for 169.254.169.254; a
   cloud's own hypervisor answers it there.
2. It asks the metadata server for the user data: GCP with
   `Metadata-Flavor: Google`, AWS through IMDSv2's session token, Hetzner
   plainly, Azure with `Metadata: true`. Four tries over at most half a minute.
3. It decodes the base64 and checks the tar entry by entry: regular files
   and directories only, names of letters, digits and `. _ - /`, no
   absolute paths and no `..`, at most 32 entries of 32 KiB each.
4. It writes a new tar of what passed, every entry owned by root and mode
   0600 (0700 for directories), to `/run/werewolf/cloud/config.tar`, and
   init extracts that.

User data that is not base64, such as a `#cloud-config`, is logged as
`none` and ignored. A tar with anything else in it is `refused` whole.

```
cloud-metadata: {"time":"2026-10-06T16:43:32Z","event":"config","provider":"aws","files":["authorized_keys","hostname"]}
```

## Separation

The program is two processes ([programs.md](programs.md)):

- **The fetcher** speaks HTTP. It runs as `_cloud` (uid 68), chrooted to
  the empty `/var/empty`, with no capabilities, under Landlock, which lets
  it reach no file and connect over TCP to port 80 alone, and a seccomp
  filter that allows a TCP socket and little else. It runs before fence
  sets the network policy, so those are what hold it. It reads at most
  128 KiB.
- **The parent** decodes, checks and writes. It never touches the network.
  It has no capabilities at all, Landlock lets it write only beneath
  `/run/werewolf/cloud`, and seccomp allows only reading the fetcher's
  pipe and writing its file.

A fetcher that misbehaves can hand the parent no more than a well-formed
config, which whoever sets the user data can do anyway: because the parent
writes the tar afresh, nothing in the fetched one but names and contents
reaches init.

## Limits

- **No one reaches the metadata server's port 80 once the machine is up.**
  fence's routing rules refuse everyone, root included
  ([docs/design/fence.md](design/fence.md)), so the user data, and any
  secret in it, stays out of every process's reach. The fetcher asks at
  boot, before those rules exist. Root could delete the rules until the
  seal takes `CAP_NET_ADMIN` away.
- **Whoever sets the user data is root on the machine**: it carries root's
  ssh keys. That is the cloud account's owner, as with cloud-init.
- **Not cloud-init.** Users, packages and scripts in a `#cloud-config` are
  not applied.
- **Four clouds.** Another is a row in the table in `cmd/cloud-metadata/cloud-metadata.zig`:
  its DMI strings, its path, and its header.
- **Azure only as a specialized VM.** Azure reboots a VM made from a
  generalized image unless an agent reports it ready, and werewolf has
  none; a VM whose OS disk is attached as it is needs no agent
  ([releases.md](releases.md#deploying)).
- Every cloud is tested against stand-ins under QEMU, with the firmware's
  strings and the metadata server faked, on every `make check`
  ([testing.md](testing.md)); GCP also for real, by `make check-gcp`.
