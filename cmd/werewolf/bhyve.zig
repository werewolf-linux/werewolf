//! bhyve: a werewolf machine as a bhyve VM on FreeBSD, experimental, from
//! the same two files every target takes: a boot disk, which bhyve's UEFI
//! firmware boots, and the config tar, attached as a second, read-only
//! virtio disk, where init finds it.
//!
//! bhyve is a process, not a service: it runs until the guest halts, and
//! exits 0 when the guest asks to reboot, to be run again. So create
//! starts it under daemon(8), detached, with its console on the machine's
//! console.log, through werewolf's own supervisor (`werewolf _bhyve`),
//! which runs bhyve again on a reboot and destroys the VM when it stops.
//! bhyve needs root, so what runs it goes through doas or sudo. The
//! machine is on slirp's network, as QEMU's user network is: the host
//! reaches it only through the ports slirp forwards, one host port per
//! port the form listens on, from a base the name's sha256 picks. bhyve
//! is the state: /dev/vmm/NAME exists while the VM does, and nothing here
//! remembers more than the form, in the machine's directory.
//!
//! x86_64 alone: bhyve on arm64 is new in FreeBSD 15, with other firmware
//! and flags, and is not built here yet.
