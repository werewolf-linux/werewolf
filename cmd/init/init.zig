//! init: PID 1 from stage0 handing over until runit takes it.
//!
//! stage0 has mounted the form's root.erofs read-only at / and handed over:
//! nothing here or after can write the root, so what changes lives in /run,
//! /tmp, /var/tmp and /data. init only has to make the machine reachable:
//! filesystems, the kernel's settings, one address, the operator's keys,
//! /data. Then it hands over to fence, which sets the network policy and
//! becomes runit; /etc/runit/2 runs the services and /etc/runit/3 shuts down.
//!
//! Every form includes minimal, so this program is in every image. It must
//! not know which form it is in: it prepares the machine and starts runit,
//! and the services a form adds take care of themselves. It decides from
//! what the image carries (a DHCP client, mke2fs, cryptsetup) and what it
//! is told, instead.
//!
//! Everything it reads comes from two places, in this order:
//!
//!     kernel command line   werewolf.ip=CIDR werewolf.gw=ADDR werewolf.dns=ADDR
//!                             (without werewolf.ip, the address is DHCP's)
//!                           werewolf.mac=ADDR (which NIC, when there are several)
//!                           werewolf.data=DEV (/data on a disk: DEV, formatted once)
//!                           (werewolf.debug=1, a root shell on the console where
//!                             the form has one, is the debug-shell service's)
//!                           and, on a machine with slots:
//!                           werewolf.victim=UUID:DIR (the filesystem holding the
//!                             slots, config.tar and data/)
//!                           werewolf.grubenv=UUID:PATH (GRUB's environment block,
//!                             which the slot-keep service writes)
//!     config                a tar written raw to any block device, or config.tar
//!                           in the victim's directory, extracted to /run/config
//!                           for the services to read (hostname and
//!                           authorized_keys are applied here); or a NoCloud
//!                           `cidata` volume, from which only the first user and
//!                           its ssh keys are taken, which is what Lima provides;
//!                           or, failing both, the cloud's metadata server.
//!
//! It runs no shell. What it cannot do itself it asks of werewolf's programs
//! (mount, modules, net, dhcp, cloud, fence) and of the filesystem tools the
//! form carries (blkid, mke2fs, e2fsck, cryptsetup), each by its full path.
//! A step that fails is said on the console and the boot goes on, as far as
//! it can; only failing to start fence ends it, which panics the kernel and
//! sends the machine back to its last good slot.
