# span

span copies one interface's packets into a pcap fifo. It opens the packet
socket and sets promiscuous mode as root, writes the pcap header, then
becomes `_span` with no capabilities and a seccomp filter of `read`,
`write`, `clock_gettime` and `exit_group`. The reader named in
`/etc/werewolf/span` is the only other process that can open the fifo.

Suricata and Zeek take it. They analyze. They never hold the capability
that captures.
