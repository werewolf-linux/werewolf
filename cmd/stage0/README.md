# stage0

## Summary

The kernel's first process on every werewolf machine: it raises lockdown,
loads the form's modules, finds the slot's disk, opens the root image
through dm-verity, mounts it read-only as the root, and hands over to the
root's `/init`. If anything fails, it panics, and the loader boots the slot
that last worked.

## Background

werewolf's root is one image, `root.erofs`, the same byte for byte on every
boot. On a machine with slots it is a file on a filesystem the kernel
command line names (`werewolf.victim=UUID:/DIR`, `werewolf.slot=a|b`): the
replaced distro's, after bite, or werewolf's own disk. Booted directly
(QEMU, Lima), it is in the initramfs. The initramfs carries the root
hash the image must match (`/verity`, `lib/verity.zig`). Nothing else runs
before stage0, so it uses the kernel alone: no shell, no blkid, no mount.

## Goals

- A root that is the image the build made, or no boot at all.
- No unsigned kernel code, ever: lockdown before any module.
- A failing slot ends in the last good one, never in a hung machine.
- Fast: the disk looked for while drivers load; the image read ahead.

## Non-Goals

- Choosing slots: the loader (GRUB or systemd-boot) does.
- Verifying the initramfs or kernel: secure boot's job
  (docs/design/verified-boot.md).

## Detailed design

1. **Mounts** `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`; parses `werewolf.victim` and
   `werewolf.slot`, both or neither, each once, the UUID 36 hex digits and
   dashes, the directory plain names only.
2. **Lockdown** to integrity, read first since it only rises.
3. **Modules**: modload, alongside the search for the slot's disk, then
   told its filesystem's kind for those modules alone; then the
   initramfs's 14 MB of modules freed, as nothing frees the initramfs.
4. **The disk**: each block device's superblock read for the UUID (ext4,
   xfs, btrfs), every 10 ms for up to 10 s. Two devices with it, as a clone
   or snapshot attached beside the disk would be, and it fails: `/data`
   and the config tar come from that filesystem too.
5. **The root**: the slot's `root.erofs` (or the initramfs's) on a
   read-only, autoclearing loop device, read ahead in the background, mapped
   by dm-verity from `/verity`, mounted erofs read-only.
6. **The deadman**, on a slot: a child with its own `/proc` and a kernel
   log descriptor opened now, which after ten minutes reboots (sysrq `b`)
   unless `/run/werewolf/committed` exists in PID 1's root, and says so.
7. **Hands over**: moves `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/victim` in, makes the
   root `/` (as switch_root), and execs `/init` with `WEREWOLF_BOOT`, how
   long each phase took.
8. **Fails** through `/dev/kmsg` at KERN_CRIT, which a panic flushes, then
   exits; the kernel panics, `panic=10` reboots.

## Drawbacks

- A second disk with the victim's UUID stops both slots booting until it is
  detached: refusal over a guess.
- A victim on an md RAID1 with its metadata at the end shows its superblock
  on each member, so it is refused, as the mount broker refuses it.

## Alternatives Considered

### An initramfs with a shell, busybox and blkid
Many tools, each a way in, for six steps the kernel does directly.

### The first device with the UUID
How it first was; a clone attached beside the disk could have supplied
`/data` and root's keys.

### Waiting for udev
There is none; the superblock is read directly every 10 ms.

## Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| A changed root image | dm-verity against the initramfs's root hash: a changed block fails to read. |
| Unsigned modules | Lockdown at integrity before modload; then the loader closes. |
| A disk standing in for the victim | Two matching UUIDs refused. |
| A crafted command line | Checked: UUID, plain directory, slot a or b. |
| A slot that boots but cannot serve | The deadman reboots it after ten minutes. |

## Reliability Considerations

- **Fails to the last good slot**: every failure panics, and the reason
  reaches the console first.
- **Says why the deadman acts**: its line reaches the kernel's log.
- **Tested**: every `make check` boots through it; `check-slot` and
  `check-updater` from a slot; `check-verity` with a changed image, which
  must not boot. The deadman's ten minutes are not yet covered.
